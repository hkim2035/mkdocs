# Good research practice

## Types of research
    - hypothesis-generating & hypothesis-testing
    - qualitative & quantitative method
    - to explain why something has happened by showing it can be subsumed under a natural law & to increase and deepen our knowledge about events, processes or texts
    - basic, applied and commissioned 

  - research: a systematic search for knowledge <- new, not simply a compilation of what is already known
  - attempting to replicate previously published (and thus not new) results with the aim of confirming them is also research
  - a systematic-critical review and compilation of previous results in a certain area can also raise knowledge levels


## Why conduct research?
So, what is it that makes research valuable? Scientific knowledge has a value not only as an instrument, in other words as::a means of achieving something else we value::. Knowledge is also worth something ::in its own right:: – has its own value – regardless of how it might be used.
The desire to know and understand is very often sufficient justification for research.
benefits of research: a case of creating conditions to produce more and new products, or increasing society’s industrial competitiveness, or even of creating more job opportunities. 
It also concerns promoting other values that have to do with **critical thinking, better quality of life and a revitalised public discourse**.
> working towards research results obtained at the higher education institution being of benefit

For the individual researcher, the purpose of research may be more personal, such as curiosity or a desire to solve a problem, contribute to the solution of some problem in society, build a career, or increase his or her income through inventions and patents. The attitude in the research community should be generous when it comes to the personal motivation of researchers.
The motivation for research can end up characterising the research environment, and the focus of the research. In an environment where the importance of commercialisation and patents is uniformly stressed, the
space for more basic research-oriented researchers can be limited. On the other hand, an environment where the value of basic research is instead placed above, anything else risks being perceived as isolated and elitist. This type of goal conflict often integral to certain types of research, such as clinical research. The risks involved with goal conflicts are reduced when the researcher is in an environment where the discourse is lively and where an open and generous view of the researchers’ motivations is maintained. The key factor is that, not why, someone wants to contribute to research, and that the significance different motivations
have for the research environment and for the focus of the research is discussed openly within research groups, departments and faculties.
